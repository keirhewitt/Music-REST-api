#### A RESTful API built from scratch with a frontend and backend; the API acts as a service that allows the frontend to have seamless communication with a database containing Music, User and Admin records.

### MongoDB 
I needed a non-relational database which was flexible enough to allow for quick and easy changes to Schema/Resources.

### ExpressJS
Previously I found Express stable for creating routes on the backend with NodeJS, therefore I chose to continue with it.

### React
React is my preferred frontend framework - it is fantastic for managing state in addition to leveraging the component system and it's accompanying lifecycle process. Plus, it allows me to stay within the JavaScript ecosystem.

### NodeJS
NodeJS and NPM are essentially a go-to for me when creating my backends if I don't go the Python route, it means I can stay with JS which has good Promise/Callback functionality when making requests, moreover, the amount of useful packages accessable by NPM makes light work of many areas.
